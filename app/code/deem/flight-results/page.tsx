          <span className="font-bold italic">Challenge:</span>
          <br />
          Provide an experience that surfaces pertinent information in a
          simplistic, cohesive manner which minimizes any potential confusion
          and the intent of the information is to direct the user to make the
          appropriate choices based on corporate and personal needs.

        <p className="text-white lg:text-lg pb-6">
          <span className="font-bold italic">Other challenges:</span>
          <br />
          Display Complex flights where more than one connection, multiple carriers,
          or flight tiers could be displayed within a single flight object.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white lg:text-lg pb-6">
          <span className="font-bold italic">Requirements:</span>
          <br />
          Encompass all existing features of the flight application,
          specifically surrounding fare tiers, policy, dynamic filtering, and fare
          comparison.

        <p className="text-white lg:text-lg pb-6">
          <span className="font-bold italic">Research:</span>
          <br />
          Reviewed Google Flights, American, Alaska, Southwest, Delta, and
          United airlines' customer-facing websites. Additionally, reviewed
          third-party consumer sites such as Expedia, Kayak, Kiwi, and others to
          gain further insight into the user experience.

            <span className="font-bold italic">Filters UX:</span> Add option for
            displaying fare tier, stops, flight times, and, other filter options
            that could be configured to be displayed above the flight objects.
            The chevron icons ({`< / >`}) are used for stepping of predefined
            values. The user also has the option to select the filter when
            hovering the filter title to expand the available options.

            <span className="font-bold italic">Use Case:</span> When a user has
            selected a stepping, all the flight objects would update to display
            the appropriate options. Let’s say the user has used Flight Times,
            which is stepped (up or down), the flight objects that match that
            stepping would be displayed and others not matching would be hidden
            from view.
